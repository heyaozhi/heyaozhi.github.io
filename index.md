Section: Project Overview

Project Theme

We built an AI assistant for emotional support in disaster/war-time scenarios, helping affected people receive immediate calming guidance and safety tips amid high stress and information chaos.
Use Scenarios and Users

Scenarios: shelters, temporary housing sites, community relief stations.
Users: affected individuals and families; volunteers act as referral and supervision roles.
Key Pain Points

High stress and fear lead to emotional dysregulation and communication difficulties.
Volunteers lack consistent, sustainable calming scripts and processes.
Language and accessibility barriers; weak network conditions are common.
Solution

Voice/text conversational emotional-support AI:
Empathic dialogue plus breathing and grounding exercises to aid self-regulation.
Safety reminders and help-seeking pathways, with escalation to human hotlines/on-site volunteers when needed.
Multilingual, low cognitive-load interaction; key flows work under weak network/offline.
Sensitive content is auto-deescalated; all guidance shows source and last update time.
Current Progress and Outcomes

Running prototype implemented: empathic opening, calming exercises, help routing, and error fallbacks.
Demo video covers three scenarios: panic relief, nighttime anxiety/insomnia, and finding help.
Initial testing feedback: natural tone and clear steps; terminology and wait time have been refined.
Next Steps

Strengthen offline and multilingual support, improve crisis triage and human escalation, and integrate with volunteer workflows for small-scale pilots.
