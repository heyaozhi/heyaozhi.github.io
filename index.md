Section: Project Overview

Project Theme

We built an AI assistant for emotional support in disaster/war-time scenarios, helping affected people receive immediate calming guidance and safety tips amid high stress and information chaos.

Use Scenarios and Users Scenarios: 
shelters, temporary housing sites, community relief stations.

Users: affected individuals and families; volunteers act as referral and supervision roles.

Key Pain Points: High stress and fear lead to emotional dysregulation and communication difficulties.
Volunteers lack consistent, sustainable calming scripts and processes.
Language and accessibility barriers; weak network conditions are common.

Solution Voice/text conversational emotional-support AI:
Empathic dialogue plus breathing and grounding exercises to aid self-regulation.
Safety reminders and help-seeking pathways, with escalation to human hotlines/on-site volunteers when needed.
Multilingual, low cognitive-load interaction; key flows work under weak network/offline.
Sensitive content is auto-deescalated; all guidance shows source and last update time.

Current Progress and Outcomes: 
Running prototype implemented: empathic opening, calming exercises, help routing, and error fallbacks.
Demo video covers three scenarios: panic relief, nighttime anxiety/insomnia, and finding help.
Initial testing feedback: natural tone and clear steps; terminology and wait time have been refined.

Next Steps: 
Strengthen offline and multilingual support, improve crisis triage and human escalation, and integrate with volunteer workflows for small-scale pilots.




Empathize — Project Overview Section

Overview
Based on interviews and online research from our presentation, we focus on emotional support and information accessibility in disaster/war contexts: under high stress and uncertainty, users need timely, trustworthy, low-effort calming and clear next-step guidance.

Key Points

Increased mental health burden: anxiety and panic are frequent during and post-conflict; self-regulation is harder (from interviewees and literature).
Safety and privacy concerns: strong desire for safe spaces alongside worries about tech security and data privacy.
Scattered information sources: critical updates are unclear and fragmented, delaying decisions and help-seeking.
Family separation and education disruption: intensify stress and hinder long-term recovery (from interviewees/literature).
Weak connectivity and limited resources: unstable networks and logistic variability require brief, real-time, and offline-capable communication.
Vulnerable groups: women and ethnic minorities show higher rates of depression/PTSD (literature).
Design Principle (one sentence)
Human-centered “short, slow, step-by-step” dialogue with breathing/grounding exercises, providing verifiable-source safety reminders and escalation pathways that work under weak network and privacy constraints.
