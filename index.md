# COMP4461 Project 3 Personal Diary – EverPresence (Social XR for Long-Distance Couples)

## 1. Project Overview and My Role

In Project 3, our team was tasked with designing a social extended reality (XR) solution for a specific local community. After several rounds of discussion and needfinding, we chose to focus on long-distance couples, especially university students in Hong Kong who are separated due to exchange, work, or migration. Our final concept, “EverPresence”, is an XR-based asynchronous virtual shared home that helps long-distance couples maintain emotional connection through a shared virtual space, joint activities, and AR/VR interactions.

My main responsibilities in this project were:
- Conducting background research and searching relevant literature;
- Collecting statistics and factual data to justify our target community;
- Proposing the core topic of “supporting long-distance couples” and contributing multiple design ideas;
- Leading the construction of the POV (Point of View) statement and creating user profiles based on teammates’ interview data;
- Participating in brainstorming and drawing one AR-related storyboard;
- Recruiting and organizing a user testing session with a PhD student and collecting feedback;
- Designing and producing several slides for the final presentation;
- Using AI tools to provide design suggestions and generate some image assets.

## 2. Design Process and My Contributions

### 2.1 Needfinding and Topic Justification

At the beginning of the project, we needed to identify a local community that could benefit from social XR. To support this decision, I took the initiative to:

- Search literature and online resources related to:
  - The prevalence of long-distance relationships among university students;
  - Emotional challenges caused by physical separation, such as loneliness and difficulty in sharing daily life;
  - Limitations of existing digital communication tools (video calls, instant messaging, social media) in providing a sense of presence and emotional support;
- Collect relevant statistics, such as:
  - The proportion of students experiencing long-distance relationships;
  - How exchange programs, work opportunities, and migration in the Hong Kong context increase the number of long-distance couples;
  - Evidence showing that current tools often fail to provide enough emotional closeness and shared context.

These data helped us justify that:
- Long-distance couples form a real and sizable community with specific emotional and practical needs;
- Traditional communication tools (video calls, text chat) have clear gaps in deeper emotional support;
- There is meaningful potential for social XR to create stronger co-presence and shared spaces.

### 2.2 Topic Selection and Early Ideation

During the topic selection phase, our team considered several communities and scenarios, such as:
- Interest-based communities;
- Residents in the same building;
- Other groups that might benefit from social support.

Throughout these discussions, I actively contributed ideas and eventually proposed the direction of “using social XR to help long-distance couples maintain their relationship”. I supported this proposal with the following reasons:
- Long-distance relationships are very common among university students;
- Emotional intimacy is strongly related to a sense of presence, which is exactly what XR can enhance;
- The scenario is highly relatable for many potential users, making it easier to empathize with them and recruit participants.

Within this theme, I also suggested multiple design concepts, for example:
- Using XR to simulate shared everyday routines (e.g., having a virtual dinner together);
- Creating virtual objects such as gifts, notes, or shared memory items that can be kept in the virtual space;
- Bringing a partner’s “traces” into the physical environment via AR, so that the other person can still feel their presence even when they are not online.

Although not all ideas were fully implemented in the prototype, these early contributions helped shape “EverPresence” as a combined VR + AR solution that supports asynchronous interaction in a shared virtual home.

### 2.3 POV Construction and User Profiles

After my teammates conducted interviews with people in long-distance relationships, I was responsible for synthesizing the findings into a clear POV statement and user profiles.

My work in this stage included:
- Reading and summarizing interview notes, focusing on:
  - Pain points: loneliness, time zone differences, lack of shared activities, high travel costs;
  - Emotional needs: feeling cared for, feeling that the partner is “there”, and being able to create shared memories;
  - Practical constraints: student budget, device availability, and time;
- Based on this, constructing a clear POV that described:
  - Who our users are (long-distance university couples);
  - What their core needs are (maintaining emotional intimacy, sharing experiences, and feeling real presence);
  - Why existing tools are not enough (they are mostly synchronous and 2D, and do not support ambient or asynchronous presence well).

I also created user profiles based on the interview data, including:
- Basic background (age, student status, etc.);
- Reasons for long-distance (exchange, work, migration);
- Daily communication habits (call frequency, texting, shared activities);
- Key worries and pain points (e.g., drifting apart, miscommunication, lack of shared context).

These POV and user profiles laid the foundation for subsequent ideation and helped us keep the design human-centered and grounded in real user needs.

### 2.4 Storyboarding and AR Concept

During ideation, we explored multiple directions, including:
- A virtual VR shared space that serves as a “home” for couples;
- Haptic feedback devices to simulate physical touch;
- AR-based companions or virtual objects appearing in the real environment.

I participated in brainstorming and helped evaluate the pros and cons of each idea. To make our concepts more concrete, we created several storyboards for different scenarios.

My specific contribution here was:
- Drawing one storyboard focusing on AR interactions, which illustrated:
  - How one partner could leave AR notes or virtual objects in the other partner’s real environment;
  - How the other partner would discover these items later, experiencing surprise and a feeling of being accompanied;
  - How this interaction could be asynchronous, helping to alleviate time zone pressure.

Through storyboarding, I helped the team:
- Visualize abstract ideas as concrete, everyday usage scenarios;
- Pay attention to emotional flow, not just functionality;
- Prepare intuitive materials for speed dating evaluations with potential users.

### 2.5 User Testing and Feedback Gathering

In the evaluation stage, we conducted qualitative user testing to understand how people perceived our concept and prototype. I was mainly responsible for recruiting and running a testing session with a PhD student.

My tasks included:
- Contacting and inviting a PhD student who had relevant experience or interest in long-distance relationships and/or XR;
- Explaining our concept and showing the prototype and related storyboards;
- Guiding the participant through the scenario and asking open-ended questions, such as:
  - “Which parts feel emotionally meaningful to you?”
  - “What kinds of activities would you like to do in such a shared virtual space?”
  - “Is there anything that feels awkward, unnatural, or hard to use?”
- Carefully taking notes on the feedback, including:
  - Comments on whether the interactions felt intuitive;
  - Suggestions for improving asynchronous communication features;
  - Opinions on the comfort, practicality, and realism of the XR solution.

I then shared these insights with the team. We used them to refine the design and to extract design implications, which were later included in our final presentation.

### 2.6 Presentation Preparation

Towards the end of the project, we needed to prepare an 8-minute presentation and a demo. I contributed mainly in the following ways:

- Designing and creating several slides, especially those related to:
  - Statistics and needfinding results from my early research;
  - The POV and user profiles that I constructed;
  - The AR concept and storyboard I contributed to;
- Making sure these slides clearly showed:
  - Why we selected long-distance couples as our target community;
  - The key insights from our user research;
  - How our solution fits the broader theme of social XR and responds to real user needs.

Although I did not present all parts during the in-class session, my work on content structure and visual presentation helped make the overall narrative more coherent, logical, and persuasive.

## 3. Reflection on My Learning

This project was a very valuable learning experience for me in several aspects:

- From “this feels reasonable” to “this is supported by evidence”:  
  At first, “long-distance couples” felt like a natural topic, but through literature search and data collection, I learned how to justify a design direction with evidence. This made our project more convincing and improved my ability to connect academic research with practical design.

- Synthesizing interviews into POV:  
  When constructing the POV and user profiles, I went beyond simply recording what users said. I needed to distill: What is the core problem? What are the underlying needs? This strengthened my skills in synthesis and abstraction, and deepened my understanding of human-centered design.

- Using storyboards to tell a story:  
  Drawing the AR storyboard made me realize the power of visualization in conveying scenarios and emotions. I had to think about where the user is, what they see, what they do, how they feel, and how interactions unfold step by step.

- Communicating with “expert-type” participants:  
  Recruiting and interviewing a PhD student was a new experience. I needed to explain the concept clearly while also handling more critical and structured feedback. This improved my communication skills with participants from different backgrounds.

- Role recognition and teamwork:  
  In this project, my role focused more on early research, POV construction, and visual/presentation content, rather than on programming the prototype. This helped me recognize my strengths in analysis and conceptual design and understand that an XR project depends on collaboration between different roles.

## 4. Reflection on AI Usage

Our team also used AI tools in this project, mainly in the following ways:

- Idea generation:  
  We used large language models to:
  - Help brainstorm more XR features and interaction patterns;
  - Explore alternative ways to support long-distance couples beyond our initial ideas.

  AI was helpful in quickly generating diverse possibilities, but not all suggestions were feasible or suitable. We still needed to filter and adapt them based on user needs and real-world constraints.

- Image generation:  
  We used image-generation tools to:
  - Produce illustrative images for our prototype and slides;
  - Visualize scenes that would be time-consuming to create manually.

  These images made our presentation more vivid and intuitive, but we had to pay attention to consistency and clarity, and sometimes we adjusted or combined AI-generated results with our own designs.

- Personal learning:  
  Through this experience, I realized that:
  - AI is a useful assistant for creativity and visualization, but it cannot replace real user research and design judgment;
  - Final design decisions must still be grounded in our understanding of actual users and contexts, rather than relying solely on AI suggestions.

I also used AI as a writing assistant while drafting this diary, mainly for organizing structure and polishing language. The experiences, facts, and reflections, however, are based on my own work in Project 3.

## 5. Conclusion

Overall, Project 3 allowed me to go through a relatively complete social XR design process: from needfinding and topic selection, to ideation and prototyping, and finally to user testing and presentation. My main contributions were in early research, POV construction, storyboard design, user testing, and presentation preparation.

Through this project, I gained:
- A deeper understanding of the challenges faced by long-distance couples;
- Practical experience integrating literature, interview data, and design methods;
- Improved skills in visual communication, user research, and reflective thinking;
- A clearer and more critical view of the role of AI in the design process.

If I had more time, I would like to:
- Recruit more actual long-distance couples for testing to increase sample diversity;
- Build a more complete and interactive VR + AR prototype;
- Explore accessibility, long-term user experience, and iterative improvement in greater depth.

This Project 3 experience strengthened my interest in designing technologies that support emotional and social needs, and showed me the potential of XR to connect people who are physically apart.
